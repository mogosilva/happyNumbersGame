# Happy Numbers Game
Guess the Three Happy Numbers!

### Goal
The goal of this project was to create a game where the user inputs three values in order to guess the "Happy Numbers"

The numbers are considered happy if ABC = A! + B! + C! where A, B, and C represent the three inputs.   
ex. 567= 5! + 6! + 7!    *//This is false so these numbers aren't "happy"*
